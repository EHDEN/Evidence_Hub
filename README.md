- Under studies we understand any coordinated effort to generate scientific insights or advance public health
- Excluded are the preparatory steps to evaluate the possibility for performing the intended study as well as the contractual / administrative preparation
- Any high level information on studies i.e. study title, description, status is accessible to all users of the evidence hub
- Study results are only accessible to the users of the respective sponsoring organisation or the participating (data partners and analysis) organisations
